# Breaking Encryption Example

# Description
This is an example of how you can utilize the frequency of letters in words in the english language to break encryption.
In this example I will break shift and vigenere encryption. Specifically, I read in ciphertext encrypted using each type of encryption and will use methods explained in
`Algorithms from Introduction of Modern Cryptography: Second Edition` to break the encryption.

# Setup
The only thing to install is a library used to colour the output
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Run
Just run `python3 main.py`
